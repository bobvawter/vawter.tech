## Summary

With 20+ years of software development and operations experience, there's nothing I can't figure out, given a terminal
window and a strong cup of coffee. I'm used to getting dropped into the middle of customer engagements to solve sticky
problems with my technical and educational acumen. I've been working in Go for the past seven years and have worked with
Java, Kotlin, JS, Typescript and various other languages over the years.

I'm based in [Reston, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston,_Virginia) and am open to travel. I've been
full-time remote since 2008.
